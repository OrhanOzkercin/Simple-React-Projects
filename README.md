## 01 - Monster Rolodex

This is the introduction project for react. Only used basics of React, nothing so special. On the other hand it's helpfull to understand how components works and how to split component. It's good practice to understand how states effect to components. When is the time components re-render. Also this project shows that React is very much better than vanilla Js when topic is seperate every thing from each other.

Main goal is:

- Understand how components works
- Learn render logic
- Use seperate components together
